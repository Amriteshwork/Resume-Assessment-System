# General Resume Evaluation Guidelines

Use these principles for **any role**. Focus on job-related, objective signals.

## 1. Core Principles

- Focus on **skills, experience, education, achievements** relevant to the job.
- Be **evidence-based**: only use info present or clearly implied in the resume + JD.
- Keep a **neutral, professional tone**. Avoid harsh or emotional language.
- Avoid commenting on or inferring **protected attributes** (age, gender, ethnicity, etc.).
- If something is unclear, say “not clearly stated” instead of guessing.

## 2. Scores (0.0–1.0) and How to Read Them

- **skills_score**  
  - How many required JD skills are present in the resume.  
  - High (≥0.8): strong match.  
  - Medium (0.5–0.79): partial match.  
  - Low (<0.5): several key skills missing or unclear.

- **experience_score**  
  - How strong and relevant the candidate’s experience is (from estimated relevant years).  
  - High: clearly meets or exceeds expected years.  
  - Medium: some relevant experience.  
  - Low: little clearly relevant experience.

- **seniority_score**  
  - Alignment with JD seniority (e.g., Junior/Mid/Senior).  
  - High: level matches expectations.  
  - Medium: slightly over/under level.  
  - Low: clear mismatch.

- **overall_score**  
  - Weighted combination of the above.  
  - ≥0.75: strong fit.  
  - 0.55–0.74: moderate fit.  
  - <0.55: weak fit for this specific role.

## 3. Structure of the Assessment

Use these **exact headings**:

1. **Overall fit**
   - Mention `overall_score` and briefly state the main reasons (skills vs. experience vs. seniority).

2. **Skills analysis**
   - Mention `skills_score`.
   - List key JD skills as: present / partly evidenced / missing or unclear.

3. **Experience and seniority analysis**
   - Mention `experience_score` and `seniority_score`.
   - Refer to roles and durations when explaining your view.

4. **Suggestions for improvement**
   - Give 3–5 **concrete** suggestions (skills to learn, how to highlight impact, clarity improvements).

## 4. Things to Avoid

- Do not mention or infer protected attributes.
- Do not fabricate experience or skills.
- Do not make strong predictions about personality or future performance.
